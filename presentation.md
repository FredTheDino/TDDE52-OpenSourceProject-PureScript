# What is Purescript?
  - Pure functional programming language *gasp*
  - Strict evaluation
  - Swappable back-ends
  - (Haskells little brother)

# The Project
  - Slow to merge changes
  - Large project with lots of areas to contribute to
  - Lots of low hanging fruit
  - Hard to get into
  - Support is varying
  - It's a programming language...
  - Would recommend if you've worked on a compiler before or is curious, but maybe not as a first open-source project
